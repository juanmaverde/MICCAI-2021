# Welcome to our tutorial page for MICCAI 2020
# October 4th 7am-11.30am PDT / 16u-19.30u CET

This tutorial is focused on an introduction to machine learning approaches for data fusion of imaging and non-imaging data for clinical decision support organized on behalf of the AMIA biomedical imaging informatics working group.

## Overview

Vast amounts of biomedical data are now routinely available for patients, ranging from radiographic images to clinical and genomic data, spanning multiple biological scales. AI and machine learning are increasingly used to enable pattern discovery to link such data for improvements in patient diagnosis, prognosis and tailoring treatment response. Yet, few studies focus on how to link different types of imaging and non-imaging biomedical data in synergistic ways, and to develop data fusion approaches for clinical decision support. This tutorial will describe considerations, approaches, software toolkits, and open challenges related to multi-omics, multi-modal and multi-scale data fusion of imaging and non-imaging biomedical data in the context of clinical decision support.
